An efficient key-value storage engine, designed for fast reading and writing, which is inspired by [Bitcask][bitcask_url].

See [Introduction](#introduction), [Installation](#installation) and [Usages](#usages) for more details.

## Introduction

Flash-KV is a high-performance key-value storage system written in Rust. It leverages a log-structured design with an append-only write approach to deliver exceptional speed, reliability, and scalability.

### Features

- **Efficient Key-Value Storage:** Optimized for fast read and write operations with minimal overhead.
- **Diverse Index:** Support BTree, Skiplist, BPlusTree index for multiple index strategies.
- **MemMap files for efficient I/O:**  To achieve rapid index reconstruction and enhance startup speeds
- **Low latency per item read or written:** Benchmarks run on a Macintosh with Apple M1 Core:
    - Write latency:  `~ 3.3 Âµs`
    - Read latency:  `~ 370 ns` 
- **Concurrency Support:**   fine-grained locking minimizes contentions.
- **WriteBatch transaction:**   commit a batch of writes to ensure atomicity.


## Installation

To use flash-kv in your project, add it as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  flash-kv = "0.2.1"
  ```
Then, run cargo build to download and compile flash-kv and its dependencies.

For more detailed setup and compilation instructions, visit the Flash-KV GitHub repository.

## Usages
Please see [`examples`].

For detailed usage and API documentation, refer to the [flash-kv Documentation](https://docs.rs/flash-kv).
